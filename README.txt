Hey Guys, this release fixes some bugs, i'm going to need you to do a few things thought

- Please go to task manager, and find anything for "Coco Z2" and end the task,
i messed up the exit code, so Coco wouldn't close properly, so please do that.

- If you ever have an error relating to internet, try to get Coco to work, then
press "DLL Install = False", now, when Coco updates, check when it updated, then
go download from here: https://gitlab.com/cococc/coco-dll-bootstrap

- If you're wondering why there's 2 buttons for each saved settings, the check boxes
were being rude to me and wouldn't work at all, sorry :/
